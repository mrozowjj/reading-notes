## HTML

### Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

### How many levels of headings are there in HTML?

HTML has 6 different levels of headings.

### What are some uses for the \<sup> and \<sub> elements?

\<sub> makes subscript and \<sup> makes super script which are characters that exist either half a line above or half a line below the normal text. It's useful to represent footnotes to a page or mathmetical formulas.

### When using the \<abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

\<abbr> is used for representing abbreviations on page. you can use it to hightlight and set a style for all the abbreviations on a page so that they look the same regardless of where on the page they appear. 

## CSS

### What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?

We can do an inline code block at the top of the page or really anywhere in the html or we can make a seperate .css files that we load in every HTML page to use later. This is prefered so you don't have to redo the CSS again for every page.

### Why should we avoid using inline styles?

It can break the website or make it look inconsistent with the rest of a page.

### Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:

### What is representing the selector?

h2 is representing the selector. It's a element selector saying all h2 headers will use the CSS in this block

### Which components are the CSS declarations?

In this css "black" and "5px" are the declarations. They are saying that the color of text will be black and the padding around the h2 element will be 5px or 5 pixels.

### Which components are considered properties?

In this css "color" and "padding" are the properties that will be changed.

### List 4 types of JavaScript operators.

Addition operator : + 

Subtraction operator : -

Multiplication operator : *

Division Operator: /

Assignment operator : =

Strictly equal operator : ===


### Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.

 You can use a function to make unit conversions that you do often like between metric and imperial units so that you don't have to redo the code every time you want to.

### An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.

An if(condition) statement will check the condition and if the condition is found to be true it will execute the code inside the {} following the if statement.

### What is the use of an else if?

An else if is used to extend the existing if statement to include another comparison nested inside the existing if.

### List 3 different types of comparison operators.

Greater than or equal too is \>=  

Less than is \<

And a looser version of equall is \== where the item has to be simlar but not necessarily scrictly exact. 

### What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?

The && is the "and" operator and \|\| is the "or" operator. With \&& both things on either side of the operator need to be true for the statement to elavualte as true with \|\| only one of the arguments needs to be true.
