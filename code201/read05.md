### Using Images In HTML. Read Common Image Types and Choosing Image Formats.

1. What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

Alt text is the text description of an image. It's useful for screen readers for visually impared and also if the image itself will not load it can give you an idea what the image was supposed to be.

2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

You can make the alt text as description as possible.

3. Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.

A figure element could be used for a image of something scientific or a news page where you can have the picture, alt text and also a caption all describing the image stored as a single object.

4. Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

A gif is a raster image and a svg is a vector image. A way to think about it is raster images are invidiual pixels like pointilism art style where vector is math based on lines so it's more like weaving a tapestry using lines of thread.

5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

Most likely a jpg because it has a good compression ratio and I'm not converned about using a lossless format like png that might increase the image size and load times for something as trivial as a screenshot.

### Using Color in CSS. Styling HTML Text Elements

1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.

Foreground color is basically the text color, border colors etc anything you use for content or to highlight content and background color that lies under everything else.

2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

Change the titles of the articles to a different color so it's easier to see when a new blog post starts and the old one ends.

3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

There's only about 5 fonts thare are considered universal fonts for websites so it's probably best to use one of those 5, Arial, Courier New, Georgia, Times New Roman, Trebuchet MS, or Verdana

4. What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

font-size = the literal size of the font, in pixels or relative to another element on the page.

font-weight = how bold the text is; as in how thin the characters in the font are.

font-style = is how you turn on italic text on or off.

5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.

I could use font-kerning to adjust the space between the letters in the words and then also the line-height to adjust the spacing between lines of text.
