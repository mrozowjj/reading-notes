## Growth Mindset

A growth mindset is the idea that you can learn or improve through effort; what you know or what you can do now are things you learned before

* Ask others for help
* Remind yourself growth is hard work
* Take a step back. If a problem is frusterating or overwhelming and you aren't making progress take a few minute break and then try again
