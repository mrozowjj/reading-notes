# Professional Competency Self-Assessment

## Areas of Strength
 - Customer Orientation - I have had a strong sense of empathy for the customer, knowing what will make their lives easier, figuring out how I can help them, etc.
 - Analytical Thinking - This seems to come very easily for me; doesn't matter if it's fixing a car engine, repairing a toilet, or a project at work I'm generally good at breaking it down in to small pieces and organizing them logically

## Areas for Growth

 - Ambition and Initiative - I am very much the kind of person that wants validation that what I'm working on or doing is the right thing to do so I find myself checking with managers before I work on anything.
 - Innovation - I struggle with this area im my professional life. I'm very good at taking existing things that improving them but have had difficulty coming up with brand new ideas.
 - Confidence - Oh boy this is a big one. Even knowing what I know I still get imposter syndrome feeling like I'm a fraud every day.
