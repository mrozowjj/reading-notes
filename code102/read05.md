## 1) What is the purpose of CSS?

The purpose of CSS it to make adding and changing the look of a webpage easier. You can use it to create a rules that the whole page follows for text color, background color, text size, text fonts, etc.


## 2) What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?

- External - This is when you create a sperate file with a .css extensions that you can then load in any html file on the project
- Internal - This is done by creating a style block \<style>\</style> at the top of an html page that allows you to specify rules for that one specific page.

- Inline - Inline is changing only a specific element on a page. See the answer below for an example


## 3) Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all \<p> elements red text. 


This code block would give all P elements red text

```
<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>
```
