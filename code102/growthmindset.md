## Growth Mindset

A **growth mindset** is the idea that you can learn or improve through effort; what you know or what you can do now are things you learned before

### Three ways to keep yourself in a growth mindset

* Learn from past mistakes
* Remind yourself growth is hard work
* Take a step back. If a problem is frusterating or overwhelming and you aren't making progress take a few minute break and then try again
